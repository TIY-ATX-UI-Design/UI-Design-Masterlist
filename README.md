# UI-Design-Masterlist

- using Chromes inspect tool to see what css attributes are being over powered (crossed out) by other attributes, and being able to narrow down your "why isn't this working" search through code

- drawing out a sketch of your design before starting any coding / being able to physically see on paper what your plan to code (divs within divs within div) is much more helpful and organizational

- giving one element multiple classes, both helps keep things organized (and in terms of sass, helps with nesting)

##Tip Number One

One thing that I've found very helpful is this link for [centering in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/).
It shows how to center both horizontally and vertically. 

##Tip Number Two

Another thing I've found to be very helpful is staying very organized within my html and css. Establishing a layout and thinking of the best names for classes and such before starting to code is helpful. Also, using comments within the code to notate different sections of styles, etc. has helped.

##Tip Number Three

Another thing that I've found to be helpful is getting a github/command line cheatsheet. It seems I can never remember the different commands so having a handy cheatsheet on my desktop is very useful!
